# CustomGPTs
Examples of CustomGPTs I have created for previous clients.  

1)Content writer for blog posts for Family law attorney.
2)Legal draft writer (motions, summaries, orders,etc) for family law attorney.
3)Automated bookkeeper for coffee shop- pulls in all Square transaction data and expenses from credit card to generated google sheet, uses it to track P&L and create monthly & quarterly statements & provides answers to relavant questions for the shop owner to make data driven menu & schedule decisions such as "What was my least profitable drink last month? On average over the past 90 days, what days of the week (or time of day) bring in the lowest revenue? What percent of my customers made a purchase at least 4 times per month in the past 3 months?"
